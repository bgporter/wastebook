## An ultra-personal publishing platform

NOTE: I'm abandoning this project as of 11/24/15. I was fed up with WordPress and thought that building my own publishing engine would be fun and fast. I learned a lot about Flask and MongoDB, but there's really no point in doing this, so this is the end of the road. 

Parking the source on github in case someday I get fed up again and have time on my hands.
